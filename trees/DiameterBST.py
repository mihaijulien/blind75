'''
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the treeâ€™s diameter. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

    Note: The length of the path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

eg.

     1
    / \
   2   3
      / \
     4   5
    /
   6

Output: 4
The number of edges between red node 2 and red node6 is 4, which is the diameter of the tree.
