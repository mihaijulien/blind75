'''
Youâ€™re given a rotated sorted array, arr, of length n, that is rotated clockwise between 1 and n times.

For example,

    Before rotation, arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

    After 33 rotations, the array becomes [6,7,8,1,2,3,4,5].

For the given array, your task is to find the minimum element of this array.
